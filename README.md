  - This folder contains 2 folders:

      It also contains an SVG file I created for the website logo and icon.
    - DunedinDairy:
      This folder contains the HTML, CSS and JS files for a simple website I created for a fictional dairy that is located in Dunedin, New Zealand, called Dunedin Dairy.
